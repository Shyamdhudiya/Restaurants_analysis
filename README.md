# 🍽️ Restaurant Data Analysis Internship Project

## 📌 Overview
This project is a part of my internship at **Cognifyz Technologies**, where I performed end-to-end data analysis using **Excel**, **Python**, **MySQL**, and **Power BI** on a real-world restaurant dataset.

The main objective was to clean, analyze, visualize, and extract insights from the dataset to understand key patterns in restaurant ratings, cuisines, pricing, and delivery trends.
